## Code examples
> Since recent times, I liked js, because of it I will give some examples of solving tasks from [codewars]( https://www.codewars.com). Based on the names of the functions, it is clear what problem it solves.

```javascript
function isTriangle(a,b,c)
{
  if((a < b+c) && (b < a+c) && (c < a+b))
   return true;
 else return false;
}
```

```javascript
function GetSum( from, to )
{
   return (Math.abs(from - to) + 1)*((from + to)/2);
}
```
